![LLM](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-Llama--3.2-orange?style=flat-square)
![Healthcare](https://img.shields.io/badge/Industry-Healthcare-red?style=flat-square)

Developed **RadLlama-3.2**, an AI model designed to automate the annotation of radiology reports, significantly improving efficiency in healthcare data processing.

- **Performance**: Achieved a **BLEU-1 score of 0.92** and **98.8% SNOMED ID mapping accuracy**, outperforming GPT-4 and human experts.
- **Efficiency**: Model is **34x faster** and **19% more accurate** than manual annotation by radiologists, reducing annotation costs by **$16.6M (99.95%)**.
- **Technologies**: Fine-tuned the **Llama-3.2 3B** model using **QLoRA** with **Unsloth** on **564,000** de-identified radiology reports.
- **Deployment**: Implemented scalable, HIPAA-compliant solutions across platforms (Streamlit, Google Cloud Platform), facilitating integration with hospital systems.
